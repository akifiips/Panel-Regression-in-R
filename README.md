# Panel-Regression-in-R

## Overview

This repository contains the R code and R Markdown files used in Medium  article titled "Panel data regression inÂ R" 

## Contents

- `DBP_Analysis.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing the complete code and documentation for the analysis.
- `DBP_Analysis.html`: The rendered HTML document generated from the R Markdown file.
- `data/`: A folder containing the dataset used in the analysis.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following R packages installed:

- `plm`
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `lattice`

You can install these packages using the following commands:

```r
install.packages("plm")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("lattice")
```


### Results

The analysis focuses on the following:

- Estimating fixed and random effects models to evaluate treatment effectiveness.
- Comparing model performance using the Hausman test.

### Further Exploration

Readers are encouraged to explore generalized linear models (GLMs) for panel data, such as logistic regression, which may be particularly useful for binary or categorical outcomes.
